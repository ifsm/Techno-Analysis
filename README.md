This is an analysis of [early House and Techno Music from Germany and the united states of AMErica (HOTGAME)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14958955). Based on recording studio features, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is trained to explore similarities and differences between US-American and German house and techno music and their evolution. Some results are available on the [techno analysis project site](https://timziemer.github.io/technoanalysis.html), particularly some interactive SOMs.

The project contains the [SOM algorithm](https://github.com/ifsm/Techno-Analysis/blob/main/som.ipynb), the [trained SOM](https://github.com/ifsm/Techno-Analysis/blob/main/2025-02-24-med-bpm-phsp-chacorr-crest.sav), and the [data normalization](https://github.com/ifsm/Techno-Analysis/blob/main/2025-02-24-med-bpm-phsp-chacorr-crest.pkl).
